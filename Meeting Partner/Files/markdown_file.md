# Summary

# Report on Electricity Fundamentals

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Electric Charge**: 
  - Two types of charges: positive and negative.
  - Charged objects can attract or repel each other based on their charge type.
  - Example: Rubbing glass with silk transfers electrons, making glass positively charged.

- **Coulomb's Law**: 
  - Fundamental principle explaining the interaction between charged objects.

- **Excess Charge Theory**: 
  - Demonstrates how materials acquire charge through friction.
  - Certain materials have different affinities for electrons, leading to charge transfer.

- **Triboelectric Series**: 
  - A ranking of materials based on their ability to gain or lose electrons.
  - Helps predict outcomes when two materials are rubbed together.

## Atoms and Electrons
- **Atomic Structure**: 
  - Nucleus contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons.
  - Negative electrons form a cloud around the nucleus.
  - Charge of an object is determined by the balance of electrons.

- **Quantization of Charge**: 
  - Electric charge exists in discrete packets, similar to Lego bricks.
  - The smallest unit is the elementary charge (e), equivalent to the charge of a single proton.

## Assignments and Lecture Materials
- **Assignments**:
  - Assignment 01 and Assignment 02 focusing on electricity concepts.
  
- **Lecture Notes**:
  - General physics notes covering fundamental ideas in electricity, including charge, current, resistance, and circuits.

## Important Theories and Terms
- **Affinity for Electrons**: 
  - Different materials interact with electrons in various ways, influencing their charge.

- **Electron Transfer**: 
  - The movement of electrons from one material to another results in a net charge on the materials involved.

## Summary
